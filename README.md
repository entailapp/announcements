# Looking Forward

Hey everyone,
 
We know that it’s been pretty quiet from us as of late and first want to apologize for the radio silence. While 2021 started off with a lot of progress for us, we faced a lot of challenges that can be summarized as side effects from the global Covid-19 pandemic in the second half of the year and into 2022. As a result, we are announcing today that any further development for Entail is on indefinite hiatus. 
 
This entire project has been a learning experience for everyone involved. Not only did we all get experience in the inner workings of project management, but this experience has also helped a lot of us in our personal career development along multiple trades. In the end however, we are all volunteers with jobs and lives outside of this project that have needed more and more attention during the course of this ongoing pandemic. Many of us have faced problems we never would have imagined in our lifetimes, and this cascaded into work grinding to a halt on this project. At this moment we are unable to determine if or when work will continue.  
 
We would like to thank all of our amazing volunteers for their contributions thus far to this endeavor.  This entire project would not even exist if it was not for the wide range of talents provided. The furry community is rich with creativity, and we had hoped to provide another solution that would enhance everyone’s experiences within the fandom.  
 
And last but certainly not least, we want to thank -you-. For believing in our vision of a new alternative to furry social networking and your enthusiasm for the approach we took with this project. We have seen literally thousands of furries show their support for this project. It was these types of posts that gave fuel to many of our volunteers to continue relentlessly working where they could to see this project through to where we are today. 
 
With that, we will not be putting everyone’s collective enthusiasm to waste. In the coming months, we will be making all of our open source code publicly available to anyone who wishes to expand on our work. A separate post will be made when this is online. We will also be looking into any viable path forward to restart this project in the future, but it is too soon to make any concrete promises. 
 
We wish everyone a great year ahead and will keep you posted with any other updates. 
 
P.S. Enny is safe and will be back again in time ;3
